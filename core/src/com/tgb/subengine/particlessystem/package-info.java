/**
 * The particle system:
 * 
 * Particle defines a particle (super-class)
 * Particles defines a set of particles
 * Emitter emits a set of particles
 * 
 * The particle manager limits the number of particles on screen (pretty stupid
 * method now, so few particles might be on screen).
 * 
 * The motion-blurred particles are quite nice, but is is deadly for the performances
